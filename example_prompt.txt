Design a simple command-line calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and some advanced operations (power, square root). The calculator should have a clean interface, handle errors gracefully, and allow users to perform multiple calculations in a session.

Requirements:
1. Support for basic operations: +, -, *, /
2. Support for advanced operations: power (^), square root (sqrt)
3. Command-line interface with clear prompts
4. Error handling for invalid inputs
5. Memory feature to store and recall the last result
6. Option to quit the application
7. History feature to review previous calculations

Make sure the code is well-documented, follows best practices, and is structured in a maintainable way.
